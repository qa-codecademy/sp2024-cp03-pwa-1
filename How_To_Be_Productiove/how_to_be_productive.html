            <h2 class="font" id="prt_one">What it means to be productive</h2>
            <p>Being productive generally means efficiently utilizing your time, energy, and resources to achieve your
              goals or desired outcomes. Productivity is about getting things done in a timely manner and making
              progress towards your objectives. Here are some key aspects of productivity:
            <ol>
              <li><b>Setting Clear Goals:</b> Productivity starts with having clear goals and objectives.
                When you know what you want to achieve, it becomes easier to prioritize your tasks and focus on what is
                important.</li>
              <li><b>Effective Time Management:</b> Productivity involves managing your time effectively.
                This includes prioritizing tasks, setting deadlines, avoiding distractions,
                and allocating time to activities that are most important.</li>
              <li><b>Focus and Concentration:</b> Being productive requires the ability to concentrate on
                the task at hand and avoid multitasking. Focusing on one task at a time can help you complete it more
                efficiently.
              </li>
              <li><b>Efficient Task Execution:</b> Productivity is about executing tasks in an efficient and effective
                manner.
                This may involve breaking down tasks into smaller steps, delegating when necessary, and using tools
                or techniques to streamline processes.</li>
              <li><b>Continuous Improvement:</b> Productivity is not just about getting things done;
                it also involves continuously improving your processes and workflows.
                This may include learning new skills, adopting better strategies, and optimizing your work environment.
              </li>
              <li><b>Work-Life Balance:</b> True productivity also includes maintaining a healthy work-life balance.
                Taking breaks, getting enough rest,
                and engaging in activities outside of work can help prevent burnout and improve overall productivity in
                the long run.</li>
              <li><b>Measuring Progress:</b> Productivity often involves tracking your progress towards your goals.
                By measuring your results, you can identify areas for improvement and make adjustments to your approach
                as needed.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              Ultimately, productivity is about maximizing your output while minimizing wasted time and effort. It's
              important to remember that being productive doesn't mean working non-stop or sacrificing your well-being.
              It's about working smart, not just hard, and finding a balance that allows you to achieve your goals while
              also taking care of yourself 
            </p>
        
            <h2 class="font" id="prt_two">Causes of Productivity</h2>
            <h4>-Positive causes</h4>
            <p>Productivity is the result of habits and practices that we learn.
              Change them and we can become more productive. Ignore them and you get the productivity you deserve.

              Despite a lot of gurus who make a lot of money telling you how to do it,
              the only person who can figure out if a given technique is going to work for you is <i>you</i>.</p>
            <p>For you to be productive, you need to pick a good environment without any distraction of noise,
              people talking to you of useless topics. Being fully concentrated is to fully dedicate to your work. In
              order to do that you will
              also need to put your phone further from you, but also you need to know when you can take a <b>break</b>.
            </p>

            <h4>-Negative causes</h4>
            <p>Low productivity is caused of many reasons, such as: lack of training, multitasking, poor management,
              lack of listening,
              ineffective communication, using social media for distraction etc.
              Having low productivity in the workplace is a widespread issue. Researches show that employees are only
              60% as productive in their workplaces as they could be. This shortfall in performance prevents companies
              from meeting consumer needs effectively, resulting in annual financial losses amounting to billions of
              dollars.
              These causes for a low productivity aren't only for the workplace. Overall saying, there could be a lack
              of motivation for
              doing body exercises, studying or even doing other hobbies. Being lazy is the first issue that needs to be
              concerned on fixing.
            </p>

            <h2 class="font" id="prt_three">How to increase your productivity</h2>
            <p>Follow these few steps and you will boost your motivation to be productive</p>
            <ol>
              <li><b>Set goals on a daily basis</b></li>
              <p>How many days have ended with you looking back and going, “Man, I’m not even sure what I accomplished
                today.”
                Obviously, every person has to spend time doing some degree of menial or repetitive labor,
                but each day you spend working should somehow be contributing to your future success.<br><br>

                Sometimes, using a <ahref link="">list like this </ahref> will help keep you on track and motivated
                since you’ll be
                able to take the day one thing at a time, rather than being overwhelmed with a bunch of unsorted
                ideas or running from one thing to another trying to figure out how to spend your time. And if you
                are someone who like to stay organized, you can also use a goal-tracking application to create lists
                and log accomplishments from wherever you are.</p>
              <li><b>Do the hardest thing first</b></li>
              <p>Early in the day, you generally have the highest energy and the least distractions, making it
                easier to focus on difficult tasks. It also sets a positive tone for the day having tackled
                your hardest task first. One way to stick to this routine is to shut off all distractions.
                This means avoid checking your email, phone, or social media until the hardest task of the day is
                complete.</p>
              <li><b>Review your week every Friday</b></li>
              <p>Some people go to bed at night with a whirlwind of thoughts rushing through their mind. They
                hardly have any time to process what they have just done simply because they are so stressed
                out about what’s directly ahead.<br><br>

                Elaborating on his productivity quote, Farquhar says he sets aside a block of time each week
                to sit down and go over the previous week so he can answer three crucial questions:<br><br>
              <ol>
                <li>Did I achieve what I wanted to achieve?</li>
                <li>Did I personally need to be there for everything I attended?</li>
                <li>Could I have achieved the same in a shorter timeframe?</li>
              </ol>
              <br><br>

              <p>This is a powerful tactic for determining whether you are really managing and spending your time wisely.</p>

              <li><b>Start with just 5 minutes</b></li>
              <p>
                Procrastination is the enemy of productivity, but we’ve all been guilty of it at some point in
                time.<br><br>

                Systrom says that he beats procrastination by committing himself to doing five minutes of whatever he is
                putting off.
                By the end of the five minutes, he ends up sitting doing and finishing the entire thing.<br><br>

                This is a perfect example of the fact that starting is the hardest part, and taking action is the most
                important thing. Sometimes later is better, but most of the time, you’ll find that going ahead and
                getting
                little things out of the way will actually increase your productivity because you’re not allowing dishes
                to
                pile up in the sink. You’re instantly washing your hands of them.
              </p>
              <li><b>Understand your priorities</b></li>
              <p>It’s not about how much time you actually have, Instead, it’s about how you choose to
                spend that time. This simple shift in mindset is empowering because it lets <b>you</b> take
                control of your day. Instead of feeling overwhelmed and time-strapped to do everything on
                your list, identify your top priorities and focus on those. The other things can wait.</p>
              <li><b>Isolate yourself from distractions</b></li>
              <p>Have you ever been laser-focused on a project and then, buzz buzz,
                Facebook friends started messaging you or emails started syncing to your phone?
                These distractions typically don’t require your attention right away, but when they
                occur in a moment of intense focus, they can seriously disrupt it. <br><br>This is a tactic
                that you could likely implement with extreme success, especially considering the number
                of distractions that we face on a daily basis. Your email likely doesn’t require your
                immediate attention, and neither does anything else that wasn’t planned for the next 1-2 hours.</p>
              <li><b>Get some sleep</b></li>
              <p>Ariana Huffington believes that sleep is a crucial component of success, and this
                is one of our top productivity tips for physical health. She suggests that overworking
                can actually hinder performance and lead to burnout. <br><br>The next time you are
                tempted to stay up late and work with a frazzled brain, get some sleep and revisit
                the task in the morning instead. Taking the time to sleep may actually help your brain recharge,
                boost cognitive performance, and ultimately improve your effectiveness at work.</p>
              <li><b>Plan for tomorrow</b></li>
              <p>In an interview we did with productivity expert David Allen,
                he told us that he always takes time at night to plan for the next day.
                He separates his obligations into two buckets, which he calls his hard landscape
                and his “soft landscape. The hard landscape refers to external commitments that
                he cannot shift around. These would be things like meetings or interviews with
                people outside of his team. He uses these obligations to create a framework for his day.</p>
              <li><b>Create a routine</b></li>
              <p>When Jack Dorsey is asked about how his top productivity tips to stay on-task as
                CEO of both Square and Twitter, notes that he has a very specific
                routine that keeps him on-track. Each day of the week has a different theme, and
                he assigns the correlating tasks to a time slot within those days. This really
                lets him dig into the theme and concepts at hand without getting distracted by
                everything else that isn’t directly related.</p>
              <li><b>Time-block your calendar</b></li>

              <p>Time-blocking is when you add specific time-chunks to your calendar to help you focus
                on specific tasks, projects, or the vision of your business. This calendar trick is
                one of the best ways to boost your productivity while also providing structure to your workday.</p>
              <li><b>Drink Water</b></li>
              <p>Water is life! We all know that, but you might be surprised to learn that even 2%
                of dehydration levels in the body can result in significant deterioration in mental
                functions. A study revealed that dehydration could cause variation in cognitive performance,
                impacting individuals’ short-term memory and arithmetic ability. So next time you
                feel thirsty, make sure to give your body all the fuel it needs to be productive. </p>
              <li><b>Avoid Multitasking</b></li>
              <p>Tackling several tasks at the same time might be tempting or sound productive, but let’s
                be honest: it’s better to do one thing at a time to guarantee the quality of the things
                we do. According to MIT neuroscientist Earl Miller, when we think we are “multitasking”,
                meaning doing several things at once, we are in fact switching from one task to another
                very rapidly at a cognitive cost. In other words: multitasking is killing your brain!</p>
            </ol>

            <h2 class="font" id="prt_five">Pomodoro technique</h2>
            <h3>What is the Pomodoro Technique?</h3>

            <div class="text-box">
              <p>The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method based on 25-minute stretches
                of focused work broken by five-minute breaks. Longer breaks, typically 15 to 30 minutes,
                are taken after four consecutive work intervals. Each work interval is called a pomodoro,
                the Italian word for tomato (plural: pomodori).</p>
            </div>
            <img id="pic_pomo" src="./images/pomodoro.png">

            <h3 id="history">History</h3>
            <p id="history">Developer and entrepreneur Francesco Cirillo created the Pomodoro Technique in the late
              1980s,
              when he was a university student and used a tomato-shaped kitchen timer to organize his study
              schedule. At first, he experimented with different work intervals, starting with two minutes
              and extending them up to one hour; he quickly realized that these were getting too long to stay
              focused on a task. He settled on 25-minute pomodori as the optimal time for his needs.</p>
            <h3>What does the Pomodoro Technique entail?</h3>
            <p>The Pomodoro Technique can also help individuals develop more efficient work habits. Through
              effective time management, they can get more done in less time, while achieving a sense of
              accomplishment and reducing the potential for burnout. To this end, the Pomodoro Technique
              includes five incremental processes to help develop a conscious and productive relationship with time:
              <br><br></p>

            <ul>
              <li><b>Pomodoro Internal Process.</b> Develop an effective relationship with time to improve productivity.
              </li>
              <li><b>Pomodoro Core Process.</b> Bring focus to the tasks in order to reach goals with less effort.</li>
              <li><b>Pomodoro Daily Process.</b> Set up a daily routine, improve the daily work process and complete
                multiple tasks more effectively.</li>
              <li><b>Pomodoro Weekly Process.</b> Set up a weekly routine, organize time more efficiently and achieve
                multiple goals.</li>
              <li><b>Pomodoro Team Process.</b> Learn to adapt the Pomodoro Technique to a team setting.</li>
            </ul>
            <div>
              <img id="pic_tomato" src="./images/tomato.png">
              <div class="text-box-two">
                <p>For each pomodoro, set aside time for recap and review to help move seamlessly from one pomodoro to
                  the next.
                  More importantly, take whatever steps necessary to stay focused on a task during the pomodoro and
                  avoid interruption.
                  Individuals need to protect their pomodoro from both internal and external distractions. Avoid
                  checking email,
                  social network accounts, weather reports, news outlets or any other diversions that can pull attention
                  away from
                  the task at hand.</p>
